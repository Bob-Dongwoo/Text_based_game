    A) Introduction:
    This game is dedicated to all the Hult students who are staying in the 
    expensive city of San Francisco. The game is targeted to give the students
    some kind of an idea how they should plan their budgets. The, game can't 
    cover every aspect of students' spending but to give a general idea about 
    what can happen throughout their time. The game will only last for 3 months
    from October 1st to December 31st due to time restrictions. Each month is 
    considered as stages. Your object is to survive every stage with the budget
    that you have planned in the start. Any feedbacks is welcomed and hope 
    you have fun.
    
    B) Known Bugs and/or Errors:
    None.
